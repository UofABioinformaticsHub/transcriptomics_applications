## Major Project

For the postgraduate students, an additional Major Project is included as part of your curriculum.
The details of this project are available [here](assignments/MajorProject.html)

## Assessment Checklist

- [ ] Identified the work as yours?
- Emails should have the course and assessment task names.
- Documents should be named with your name, the course name and the assessment task.
- Printed documents should have you name and the course and assessment task in the text/footer/header.
- [ ] Used appropriate electronic communication with assessors?
- Emails should have a meaningful subject.
