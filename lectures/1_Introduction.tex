	\begin{itemize}
		\item The start of any academic year is an exciting time - but it can also be challenging for our students, for many reasons
		\item For some of our students, this year is especially challenging
		\item That’s because many of our students who wanted to be here to study can’t be here - because of COVID-19 and the travel restrictions to Australia
		\item This is not a situation that those students - or any of us in this room today - have any direct control over
		\item We may have some students watching this very lecture from overseas
	\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Welcome to the University of Adelaide}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Before the lecture begins, there are some points worth making so that everyone understands what the current situation is here at the University of Adelaide
		\item We have a diverse, inclusive, and welcoming community at our University, which is something we’re very proud of
		\item In times of difficulty, that community is more important than ever.
		\item This is a time when our community comes together as a whole so we can care for and support each other together
		\item It’s particularly important for those who may be going through a more difficult time than otherwise. 
		\item We must be respectful of other people - and that includes the many students who couldn’t join us in the room today
