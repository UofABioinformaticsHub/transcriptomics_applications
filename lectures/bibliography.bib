In this review, we present a comprehensive analysis of promoters and their underlying mechanisms in transcriptional regulation, including epigenetic marks and chromatin-based regulation. Large-scale prediction of promoter sequences and their contributing cis-acting elements has become routine due to recent advances in transcriptomic technologies and genome sequencing of several plants. However, predicted regulatory sequences may or may not be functional and demonstration of the contribution of the element to promoter activity is essential for confirmation of regulatory sequences. Synthetic promoters and introns provide useful approaches for functional validation of promoter sequences. The development and improvement of gene expression tools for rapid, efficient, predictable, and high-throughput analysis of promoter components will be critical for confirmation of the functional regulatory element sequences identified through transcriptomic and genomic analyses."

    abstract = {Author Summary To do their jobs, many RNAs need to fold into structures (through base-paring). We were interested in the conformation of a specific mammalian RNA, Xist, when it is inside a cell. Xist is a very large non-coding RNA (lncRNA), that is >17,000 nt long. Xist is particularly important because it is one of the first lncRNAs to be discovered, and turns genes off across an entire chromosome. To figure out how Xist RNA is folded in mouse cells, we developed a new approach, Targeted Structure-Seq, to examine the conformation of large RNAs like Xist. Using computer modeling, we identified parts of Xist that are base paired into RNA duplexes. We also determined which parts of the Xist RNA are likely to be structured. This work provides a new tool for studying the secondary structure of any large RNA, and helps us understand what the important pieces of Xist look like while Xist does its work in the cell.},

    abstract = {Transcriptomics technologies are the techniques used to study an organism’s transcriptome, the sum of all of its RNA transcripts. The information content of an organism is recorded in the DNA of its genome and expressed through transcription. Here, mRNA serves as a transient intermediary molecule in the information network, whilst noncoding RNAs perform additional diverse functions. A transcriptome captures a snapshot in time of the total transcripts present in a cell. The first attempts to study the whole transcriptome began in the early 1990s, and technological advances since the late 1990s have made transcriptomics a widespread discipline. Transcriptomics has been defined by repeated technological innovations that transform the field. There are two key contemporary techniques in the field: microarrays, which quantify a set of predetermined sequences, and RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq), which uses high-throughput sequencing to capture all sequences. Measuring the expression of an organism’s genes in different tissues, conditions, or time points gives information on how genes are regulated and reveals details of an organism’s biology. It can also help to infer the functions of previously unannotated genes. Transcriptomic analysis has enabled the study of how gene expression changes in different organisms and has been instrumental in the understanding of human disease. An analysis of gene expression in its entirety allows detection of broad coordinated trends which cannot be discerned by more targeted assays.},

ESTs have applications in the discovery of new human genes, mapping of the human genome, and identification of coding regions in genomic sequences. Of the sequences generated, 337 represent new genes, including 48 with significant similarity to genes from other organisms, such as a yeast RNA polymerase II subunit; Drosophila kinesin, Notch, and Enhancer of split; and a murine tyrosine kinase receptor. Forty-six ESTs were mapped to chromosomes after amplification by the polymerase chain reaction.

Several procedures are available to detect Chinese SBV (CSBV) in clinical samples, but not to estimate the level of CSBV infection. The aim of this study was develop an assay for rapid detection and quantification of this virus. Primers and probes were designed that were specific for CSBV structural protein genes. A TaqMan minor groove binder (MGB) probe-based, fluorescence real-time quantitative PCR was established. The specificity, sensitivity and stability of the assay were assessed; specificity was high and there were no cross-reactivity with healthy larvae or other bee viruses. The assay was applied to detect CSBV in 37 clinical samples and its efficiency was compared with clinical diagnosis, electron microscopy observation, and conventional RT-PCR. The TaqMan MGB-based probe fluorescence real-time quantitative PCR for CSBV was more sensitive than other methods tested. This assay was a reliable, fast, and sensitive method that was used successfully to detect CSBV in clinical samples. The technology can provide a useful tool for rapid detection of CSBV. This study has established a useful protocol for CSBV testing, epidemiological investigation, and development of animal models.},

To test the system, 864 physically mapped lambda clones of yeast genomic DNA, together representing >75% of the yeast genome, were arranged into 1.8-cm x 1.8-cm arrays, each containing a total of 1744 elements. The microarrays were characterized by simultaneous hybridization of two different sets of isolated yeast chromosomes labeled with two different fluorophores. A laser fluorescent scanner was used to detect the hybridization signals from the two fluorophores. The results demonstrate the utility of DNA microarrays in the analysis of complex DNA samples. This system should find numerous applications in genome-wide genetic mapping, physical mapping, and gene expression studies.},

 abstract = {The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

It is often the case that thousands of features in a genomewide data set are tested against some null hypothesis, where a number of features are expected to be significant. Here we propose an approach to measuring statistical significance in these genomewide studies based on the concept of the false discovery rate. This approach offers a sensible balance between the number of true and false positives that is automatically calibrated and easily interpreted. In doing so, a measure of statistical significance called the q value is associated with each tested feature. The q value is similar to the well known p value, except it is a measure of significance in terms of the false discovery rate rather than the false positive rate. Our approach avoids a flood of false positive results, while offering a more liberal criterion than what has been used in genome scans for linkage.},

Negative binomial models are used to capture the quadratic mean-variance relationship that can be observed in RNA-seq data. Conditional likelihood methods are used to avoid bias when estimating the level of variation. Empirical Bayes methods are used to allow gene-specific variation estimates even when the number of replicate samples is very small. Generalized linear models are used to accommodate arbitrarily complex designs. A key feature of the edgeR package is the use of weighted likelihood methods to implement a flexible empirical Bayes approach in the absence of easily tractable sampling distributions. The methodology is implemented in flexible software that is easy to use even for users who are not professional statisticians or bioinformaticians. The software is part of the Bioconductor project.",

We demonstrate how GSEA yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common.
