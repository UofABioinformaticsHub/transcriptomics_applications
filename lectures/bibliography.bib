abstract = "Studies of promoters that largely regulate gene expression at the transcriptional level are crucial for improving our basic understanding of gene regulation and will expand the toolbox of available promoters for use in plant biotechnology. In this review, we present a comprehensive analysis of promoters and their underlying mechanisms in transcriptional regulation, including epigenetic marks and chromatin-based regulation. Large-scale prediction of promoter sequences and their contributing cis-acting elements has become routine due to recent advances in transcriptomic technologies and genome sequencing of several plants. However, predicted regulatory sequences may or may not be functional and demonstration of the contribution of the element to promoter activity is essential for confirmation of regulatory sequences. Synthetic promoters and introns provide useful approaches for functional validation of promoter sequences. The development and improvement of gene expression tools for rapid, efficient, predictable, and high-throughput analysis of promoter components will be critical for confirmation of the functional regulatory element sequences identified through transcriptomic and genomic analyses."

    abstract = {Author Summary To do their jobs, many RNAs need to fold into structures (through base-paring). We were interested in the conformation of a specific mammalian RNA, Xist, when it is inside a cell. Xist is a very large non-coding RNA (lncRNA), that is >17,000 nt long. Xist is particularly important because it is one of the first lncRNAs to be discovered, and turns genes off across an entire chromosome. To figure out how Xist RNA is folded in mouse cells, we developed a new approach, Targeted Structure-Seq, to examine the conformation of large RNAs like Xist. Using computer modeling, we identified parts of Xist that are base paired into RNA duplexes. We also determined which parts of the Xist RNA are likely to be structured. This work provides a new tool for studying the secondary structure of any large RNA, and helps us understand what the important pieces of Xist look like while Xist does its work in the cell.},
